ABOUT THE PROJECT 

This project aims at exploring this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if 
we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates 
of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers and 
observing the effect this changing rate has on the apparent mean age of death of left
handed people. 
It uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age 
at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed. 

AIM

To analyze the death age difference between right handers and left handers. 

OBJECTIVES 

To achieve the above set goal, the following objective will be considered: 
1. Studying death distribution data in United States from the year 1999 and rates 
of left handedness. 
2. Calculating the probability of dying at age A given that you're left-handed 
using Bayesâ€™ rule. 
3. Getting the overall probability of lefthandedness. 
4. Using Bayes' rule to get P(A | LH), the probability of being age A at death (in 
the study year) given that you're left-handed. 
5. Comparing the results with the original study that found that left-handed 
people were nine years younger at death on average.
